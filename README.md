# morning-weather

A simple script getting weather conditions at sunrise and sending it to the Jawbone wristband UP app (well kinda, you still need an IFTTT account to use [this recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/460158-send-weather-to-jawbone-up-app)).

Install packages : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
